        <p>Bike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city. Using these systems, people are able rent a bike from a one location and return it to a different place on an as-needed basis. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world.</p>
<p>The data generated by these systems makes them attractive for researchers because the duration of travel, departure location, arrival location, and time elapsed is explicitly recorded. Bike sharing systems therefore function as a sensor network, which can be used for studying mobility in a city. In this competition, participants are asked to combine historical usage patterns with weather data in order to forecast bike rental demand in the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C.</p>

        <p>To provide Bike lender companies how many bikes will get rented or shared according to weather conditions.</p>
<p>1. Build a Regression Model that can predict the bike rentals counts hourly with respect to weather conditions.Try out  various predictions  models, and deploy the evaluations of the models at AWS S3.</p>
<p>2. Develop a web application where company can input weather conditions ,date and hour and time.After giving a input we can predict the count of how many bikes will be lend(shared).</p>
<p>3. It will help Bike Sharing company to predict and strategize their future bike renting strategies.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="DEPLOYMENT OF THE ARCHITECTURE" duration="0">
        <p><strong>Explanation on Implementation</strong></p>
<p><strong>PART 1: EDA</strong></p>
<p>1. We used a dataset from Kaggle Competition </p>
<p>2. We did exploratory analysis on the training dataset</p>
<p>3. Found observation such as zero values found for humidity and wind speed variables </p>
<p>4. Further We found that temperature and feels like temperature is highly correlated </p>
<p>5. There is only one datapoint with Heavy Rain in the entire Training Dataset and two in the testing data</p>
<p>6. Found some features which we assume to be important for prediction like temperature , hour , month , humidity , working day and  ,weather </p>
<p><strong>PART 2: PreProcessing </strong></p>
<p>1. Pre process the data and added features derived from datetime  </p>
<p>2. Tried out different regression models and summarized the output</p>
<p>3. Selected the best model from the summarized data</p>
<p>4. Built a pipeline for PArt 2 using Luigi</p>
<p><strong>PART 3: Grid Search and Feature Selection</strong></p>
<p>1. Took the best model (Random Forest Regressor) after Part 2 and tuned the hyperparameters </p>
<p>2. Selected best features using Backward, Forward and Boruta to the tuned model</p>
<p>3. Pickled the model and deployed to AWS</p>
<p>4. Built a pipeline for Part 2 using Luigi</p>
<p><strong>PART 4: Auto ML Models </strong></p>
<p>1. Used H2O, TPot and BIGML to automatically predict the bike rentals</p>
<p>2. Selected best models from each Auto ML Models</p>
<p><strong>PART 5: Separate Prediction using Casual and Registered Bikers</strong></p>
<p>1. Predicted Casual and Registered Bikers using tuned Random Forest Regressor</p>
<p>2. Aggregated the two to predict the Total Count of bike rentals</p>
<p><strong>PART 6: Azure ML Studio</strong></p>
<p>1. Predicted the bike rentals mean and standard deviation hourly using Random Forest Regressor</p>
<p>2. Created a web service using and deployed the same on Azure</p>

<p><strong>PART 7: Flask Application</strong></p>
<p>1. Develop a flask application where one can input weather conditions and time data</p>
<p>2. After giving a input we can predict the count of how many bikes will be lend(shared)</p>
